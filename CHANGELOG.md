## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

The foundation: install, update, add routers, see them, and stay out of a running test's way.

### Added

- Per-user Windows installer (no admin rights) with the data folder chosen at install time; Python is bundled.
- Update check against GitHub Releases at start-up and daily, with a stable and a CI pre-release channel.
  Downloads are verified against `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the previous installer is kept for "Reinstall previous version".
- App shell with light, dark and system themes, usable from 375 px to full-screen widths.
- Add-router wizard: host key check and pinning, one login with the root password (or a key file), installing
  the app's own SSH key with the exact command shown first, the router's self-description, socket labels
  proposed from `board.json`.
- Router self-description probe, read the way LuCI reads it: `board.json`, ubus services, typed option lists,
  feature flags and LuCI menu entries.
- Dashboard: router cards (radio, stations, network, login), an air map per band, and a "Needs attention" list.
- Bench Guard: while a harness run is live (lock files, processes on this PC, run SSIDs on air), every router
  is read-only and a banner names the run. The watch list is editable in Settings.
- Terminal per router: a full shell, or a read-only command line during a harness run.
- Audit log of every command sent, with secrets masked, filters, and a zip export for bug reports.
- Router simulator built from recorded router output, used for e2e tests, screenshots and demos.
- CI, pre-release and release workflows, wiki sync, CodeQL and Dependabot.
